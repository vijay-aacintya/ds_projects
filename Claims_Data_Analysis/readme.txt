The project's goal is to implement claims data analytics to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. Tasks include acquiring a claims dataset, cleaning and preprocessing it, conducting exploratory data analysis, implementing machine learning algorithms to detect outliers, analyzing trends over time, and developing predictive models. The findings will be communicated through interactive visualizations. Key steps involve reading data from a CSV file, cleaning and preprocessing it, and saving it for further analysis. The objective is to enhance the claims process using insights derived from the data.

SweetViz, Dtale libraries were used to perform the EDA.
Pycaret Libabries are used to find the best model to predict the target.
