XYZ company would like to know whether employee works for the company will stay with the company after the recent evaluation or not. Also would like to know what factors influence whether the employee stays or not.

XYZ company has provided the dataset with various features - ['satisfaction_level', 'last_evaluation', 'number_project', 'average_montly_hours', 'time_spend_company', 'Work_accident', 'left', 'promotion_last_5years', 'Department', 'salary']

**Employee Retention Analysis was performed using Regression Analysis.

EDA was not performed for the dataset, to check out how to do it, see my Food Hub Project
