Job Post Response Email generator for an individual  using groq and langchain. It allows users to input the URL of a company's careers page.

There is a job posting in dice.com. You provide the direct URL to the job post to the LLM, then this program will generate an email response to the job post highlighting on how your skill match the requirement.
