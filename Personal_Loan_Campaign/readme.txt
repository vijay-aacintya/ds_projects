AllLife Bank aims to convert its depositors (liability customers) to personal loan customers to boost loan business and interest earnings. Despite a small base of borrowers (asset customers), a previous campaign achieved over 9% conversion, inspiring targeted marketing efforts. As a Data Scientist, your task is to develop a model to predict which liability customers are likely to purchase personal loans, identify key customer attributes influencing these decisions, and determine the most promising customer segments for targeting. This analysis will enhance the effectiveness of future marketing campaigns and overall business strategy.
